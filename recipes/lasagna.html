        <p>For this recipe you will need the following ingredients:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>One table spoon of olive oil</li>
            <li>One diced onion</li>
            <li>One diced carrot</li>
            <li>One diced celery stick</li>
            <li>Two finely sliced cloves of garlic</li>
            <li>250g of beef mince</li>
            <li>250g of pork mince</li>
            <li>One table spoon of tomato puree</li>
            <li>400g tin of chopped tomato</li>
            <li>200ml of beef stock</li>
            <li>200ml of red wine</li>
            <li>One table spoon of worcestershire sauce</li>
            <li>Ten lasagna sheets</li>
            <li>50g of grated parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>150g of shredded mozzarella</li>
        </ul>
        <p>For the white sause:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>50g of butter</li>
            <li>50g of plain flour</li>
            <li>500ml semi-skimmed milk</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Once you've gathered your ingredients, follow the following steps:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large pan, heat the olive oil over a low heat. Fry the onion, carrot, celery and garlic for 5 mins, or until softened. Add the mince and fry on a medium heat until golden. Turn up the heat, pour in the wine and bubble until reduced. Stir in the tomato purée, chopped tomatoes and stock. Add in the Worcestershire sauce and simmer for 15 mins, or until the liquid has reduced. Season.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, make the white sauce. Melt the butter in a small saucepan over a low heat and add the flour. Whisk until combined and cook on low for 1-2 mins. Remove from the heat and gradually whisk in the milk until you have a loose sauce. Season. Return to a gentle heat and whisk constantly until the sauce thickens.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to gas 6, 200°C, fan 180°C. Layer up the lasagne in a baking dish, starting with a third each of the ragu, then the pasta, then the white sauce. Repeat twice. Top with the Parmesan and mozzarella then bake in the oven for 40-45 mins, until piping hot and crisp and bubbling on top. Serve immediately.</li>
